The stock homming macro as March 2024 has a bug making it homing only one axis in some case.
Replace in printer.cfg by this one to fix the issue.

May : Thank to Jpe230 we now have the 230 macro fix too.
DetectingGuy Point to the non working load-unload and filament runout, here these are corrected.

In bonus i made a "violent" profil for Cura by scrapping the values int the gcode that was ship with my printer.
